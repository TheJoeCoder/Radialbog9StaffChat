# Radialbog9 Staff Chat
Adds Chatting capabilities for staff!


This plugin *does not* require StaffChatAPI to work on its own. If you download add-ons for this plugin, you will *need* StaffChatAPI *as well*.

Radialbog9 StaffChat (formerly known as Bungee StaffChat) gives the ability to chat in a separate chat from other players on your server network. It is created in the style of Performium's StaffChat plugin and is a great alternative.

## Permissions
• staffchat.use - Allows the player who has the permission to run the /ao command.
• staffchat.see - Allows the player who has the permission to see the staff chat messages sent.
• staffchat.help - Allows the player who has the permission to run the /scinfo command and get help on using the plugin.

## Installation
1) Download the plugin and put it in your BUNGEECORD Plugins folder.
2) Startup bungeecord (make sure you have set up your permissions if you don't have a bungee permissions manager).
3) Chat on!
